Module 8 Assignment
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
        In order to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable I ensured I wrote clean, precise, and well commented code to ensure that it was easy to follow along and wasn't unnecessarily long. I would utilize this CRUD Python module in the future if I wanted to create similar ideas or projects. 
        
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
                  Approaching the problem as a computer scientist means approaching it from an angle of just getting it done. I personally look at the big picture and continously break down the picture until it is set at a level where I can now start developing on it. I refer back to the software development lifecycle a ton for when I'm looking at taking on new project.
        
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists do a multitude of things but mainly they use code, theory, math, and more to create something that a stakeholder wants. My work on this project could benefit a company greatly by implementing solid and scalable client/server sided development for whatever they may have. It has given me experience and the ability to feel relatively comfortable utilizes all the tools I did in this class.
